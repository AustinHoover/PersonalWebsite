    <div class="project-name">Real Time Strategy Framework</div>
    <div>The goal of this project was to create a framework which I could develop strategy games off of. I developed many various technologies for this framework.</div>
    <div>Approximate Start Date: December 2015</div>
    <div>Source code: Please contact me for access to the source code.
    <div>

    <div class="sample-text">Sample Images</div>
    <br>
    <div><img src="sample-world-1.png" alt="sample-world-1.png"></div>
    <div>A sample of a generated gameworld.</div>
    <br>
    <div><img src="sample-world-2.png" alt="sample-world-2.png"></div>
    <div>Another sample gameworld.</div>
    <br>
    <div><img src="sample-world-3.png" alt="sample-world-3.png"></div>
    <div>A third gameworld.</div>
    <br>
    <div><img src="coastal-compare.png" alt="coastal-compare.png"></div>
    <div>The green is land by the coast. The light blue is coastal-depth waters. The dark blue is inter-continental-depth waters.</div>
    <br>
    <div><img src="town.png" alt="town.png"></div>
    <div>A procedurally generated town. Projectiles and units both have collision with each wall in the structure.</div>
    <br>
    <div><img src="range.png" alt="range.png"></div>
    <div>A view that shows the ranges of given units. The ships in the ocean have turrets that can fire even if they're not facing their target.</div>
    <br>
    <div><img src="analysis.png" alt="analysis.png"></div>
    <div>The engine tries to evenly distribute units for both players across the map so that the starting positions are relatively equal.</div>
    <br>
    <div><img src="zone-control.png" alt="zone-control.png"></div>
    <div>The game keeps track of who has control of what region of the world. The goal was to have economic mechanics based on this eventually.</div>
